# epi-embedding-maps-viewer

## This is just a small page to view [Epi's Embedding Maps](https://civitai.com/articles/8977)

This is a simplified version of viewing **Epi's Embedding Maps**.  
The main reason for creating this page was the desire to have a less laggy interface for viewing these maps.

Creator of the original maps ‚Äî [epiTune](https://civitai.com/user/epiTune).

   2. Drag the map onto the `.html` file you downloaded in the first step to view it in the browser.
3. Don't forget to redownload the viewing page after a new update is released.
4. Done

## ‚ö† Important

1. The search uses regular expression syntax (RegEx). For reference, you can check out the [guide to regular expressions](https://regex101.com/).

    | **Symbol** | **Description**             | **Example**                      |
    |------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
    | `.`        | Any character except newline| `h.t` ‚Äî matches "hat", "hit", "hot" |
    | `\d`       | Any digit (0-9)             | `\d+` ‚Äî matches "123", "4567" |
    | `\w`       | Word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _) | `\w+` ‚Äî matches "hello", "world123" |
    | `^`        | Start of string             | `^Hello` ‚Äî matches strings starting with "Hello" |
    | `$`        | End of string               | `world$` ‚Äî matches strings ending with "world" |
    | `[abc]`    | Any character in set        | `[abc]` ‚Äî matches "a", "b", or "c" |
    | `[^abc]`   | Any character not in set    | `[^abc]` ‚Äî matches anything except "a", "b", or "c" |
    | `*`        | 0 or more repetitions       | `ab*c` ‚Äî matches "ac", "abc", "abbc", etc. |
    | `+`        | 1 or more repetitions       | `ab+c` ‚Äî matches "abc", "abbc", but not "ac" |
    | `?`        | 0 or 1 repetition           | `colou?r` ‚Äî matches "color" or "colour" |
    | `{n,m}`    | Between n and m repetitions | `a{2,4}` ‚Äî matches "aa", "aaa", or "aaaa" |

    | `\`        | Escape special characters   | `\.` ‚Äî matches a literal dot "." |

    Notes:
   - Use `\` to escape special characters if you want to search for them literally (e.g., `\.` to search for a period).
   - Patterns can be combined for more complex searches.
2. The file `v0-artists-8192.json` is too big (132MB) for GitHub (<100MB), so it was uploaded separately to Google Drive: [v0-artists-8192.json](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1S3P8qu8fByQ1XMa6afyDW46oxxaa6_a1)
   - This is the original version, in the index there is a version with pictures converted to webp (63 quality) to compress the file to the 100 MB limit.
   - If you want to use this file, download it and drag it to the viewing page.

## Keyboard shortcuts

2. `Ctrl + Click` (controls) ‚Äî Activate a button without animation, if possible
3. `Ctrl + Click` (cards) ‚Äî Copy title
4. Holding `Alt` (cards) ‚Äî Possibility to select text in the title

## Useful Information

### Render Engine

You can select the rendering method for displaying cards:

1. **HTML Element**: Very slow.
2. **Canvas 2D**: Faster than HTML Element but slower than Canvas WebGL2.
3. **Canvas WebGL2**: Extremely fast.  
   - Uses VRAM even if hardware acceleration is disabled in the browser, so if this is critical, it's better to choose Canvas 2D.

## Changelog

### Update `10.01.25`

- Improved overlap fix
- Now map data is stored separately from their meta information required for display in the list (The data list loads faster when opening the page)
