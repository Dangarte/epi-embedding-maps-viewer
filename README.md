# epi-embedding-maps-viewer

## This is just a small page to view [Epi's Embedding Maps](https://civitai.com/articles/8977)

This is a simplified version of viewing **Epi's Embedding Maps**.  
The main reason for creating this page was the removal of old maps from threads and the desire to have a less laggy interface for viewing these maps.  

If you want to support the creator of the original maps, here is their profile on civitai ‚Äî [epiTune](https://civitai.com/user/epiTune).

## How to use?

1. Open the page at the link [epi-embedding-maps-viewer](https://dangarte.github.io/epi-embedding-maps-viewer/)
2. Select a map
3. Done

### üè† Offline mode

1. Open the page as usual and press `Ctrl + S` to download it. The browser will handle what needs to be saved.  
2. In offline mode, the map index loading is disabled (it can be enabled with the `--TODO-insert-flag-here` parameter), so you need to download the maps manually:  
   1. Open the `/data` folder in this repository and download any maps you need.  
   2. Drag the map onto the `.html` file you downloaded in the first step to view it in the browser.  
3. Done

## ‚ö† Important

The file `v0-artists-8192` is too big (132MB) for GitHub (<100MB), so it was uploaded separately to Google Drive: [`v0-artists-8192`](https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1S3P8qu8fByQ1XMa6afyDW46oxxaa6_a1)
If you want to use this file, download it and drag it to the viewing page.
